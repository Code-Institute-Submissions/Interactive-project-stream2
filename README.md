# DISCLAIMER: This Project was created for educational purposes ONLY.

FBI API and data manipulation Project with RESTful/wrapper APIs. Used with the FBI Crime Data Explorer API. 

# Crime Data Explorer FBI Website
 
## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
This is a website for anyone interested in searching Data comparisons between different ethnicities, types of crimes and the real amount of victims/offenders in each one.
It specifically design to access real time Data provided by the public FBI API. Extremely useful for lawyers, political campaign uses, non-profits, NGOÂ´s, civil right advocates and special interest groups.
 
### What does it do?
 
This website has two main searching parameters, first being the type of felony/crime you want to search for and second being the race and or year (you can speacify a year or search for the ones available 1991-2016).

### How does it work
 
This website uses **Java-Script** and **jQuery** to route viewers through the site. The site is styled with **Bootstrap**, **css3** and **Google Fonts**. The data was being originally called from the front-end using **Javascript** and **JQuery** code. Mid-way through the project the FBI API changed not only creating a unic API key for each user (provided at request) but also restructuring the data provided, including more and better parameters for the searchs. This changes also included the use of CORS, (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) that avoided the class from the front end. This made necessary the creation of a specific back end (restful-wrapper API) to meet the new requirements. The restful-API part of the project can be viewed [HERE](https:#).
